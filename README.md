Python versions of perturbation methods presented in paper by Judd and Guu

This repository contains the Python versions of the perturbation models presented in Judd & Guu (1993). This paper gives 
three examples of perturbation in Mathematica, all based on a simple optimal growth model: (1) continuous-time 
deterministic; (2) continuous-time stochastic; (3) and discrete-time deterministic.

All models go with some notes in pdf but for a proper explanation I recommend reading the original paper by Judd & Guu.
